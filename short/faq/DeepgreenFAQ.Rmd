# On ubuntu, after turning on deepmesh, query hang.

Most likely this is a network issue.   Especially, check /etc/hosts file on
*EVERY* machine of the cluster to see if ubuntu has inserted an entry like
```
127.0.1.1 machine_host_name
```

See the [follwing link](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_hostname_resolution) for reason of this weird entry.

Remove it and replace it with the correct ip of the host.
